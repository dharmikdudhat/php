      Today is the day, please don't skip this 1-minute read. We're sorry to
      interrupt, but it's Tuesday, 10 September, and our fundraiser doesn't last
      long. We request you to reflect on the number of times you visited
      Wikipedia in the past year and if you're able to donate ₹ 25 to the
      Wikimedia Foundation. If everyone reading this gave ₹ 25, we'd reach our
      goal in a few hours. In the age of AI, access to verifiable facts is
      crucial. Wikipedia is at the heart of online information, powering
      everything from your personal searches to emerging AI technologies. Your
      donation strengthens the knowledge of today and tomorrow. Just 2% of our
      readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still
      provides you with ₹ 25 worth of knowledge, kindly donate today. If you are
      undecided, remember that any contribution helps, whether it's ₹ 25 or ₹
      1,000.
